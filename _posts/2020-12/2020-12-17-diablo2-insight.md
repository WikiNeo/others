Insight is the rune word `RalTirTalSol` for polearms or staves in Diablo II:
Lord of Destruction.

Insight is popular among casters due to the relatively cheap runes necessary for its creation, along with the Meditation aura it provides. Instead of wielding it themselves, most players let their Act 2 mercenaries carry them.
