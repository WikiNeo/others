Rhyme is the rune word 'ShaelEth' for shields in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction.

Rhyme is an easy way to get the useful Cannot be Frozen effect; characters wearing a Rhyme shield can't be slowed by cold attacks outside of Holy Freeze. This effect is especially useful for melee characters in Hell difficulty, where many monsters deal cold damage with long chill durations. Rhyme also has the highest Magic Find attribute in a shield, outside of using Ist runes in a socketed shield.

Result:

- 20% Increased Chance of Blocking
- 40% Faster Block Rate
- +25 to All Resistances
- Regenerate Mana 15%
- Cannot Be Frozen
- 50% Extra Gold From Monsters
- 25% Better Chance Of Getting Magic Items
