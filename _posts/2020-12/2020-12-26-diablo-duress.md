Duress is the rune word 'ShaelUmThul' for body armor in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction.

Duress is aimed specifically at physical fighters. It is relatively easy to construct and offers a high chance of Open Wounds. Its chance of Crushing Blow is not high, but when combined with other equipment (such as Gore Rider or Goblin Toe) players are likely to knock large percentages off an enemy's life in short order. Finally Duress grants good cold resist, a high defense bonus, and moderate bonuses to fire, lighting, and poison resists.
