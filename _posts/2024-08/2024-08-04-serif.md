In typography, a serif (/ˈsɛrɪf/) is a small line or stroke regularly attached
to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font or
family of fonts. A typeface or "font family" making use of serifs is called a
serif typeface (or serifed typeface), and a typeface that does not include them
is sans-serif. Some typography sources refer to sans-serif typefaces as
"grotesque" (in German, grotesk) or "Gothic"[1] (although this often refers to
blackletter type as well) and serif typefaces as "roman" (or in German,
Antiqua).

Serif typefaces can be broadly classified into one of four subgroups: § old
style, § transitional, § Didone and § Slab Serif, in order of first appearance.
Some Old-style typefaces can be classified further into one of two subgroups: §
Antiqua and § Dutch Taste.
